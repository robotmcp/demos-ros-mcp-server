# TurtleBot3 Simulation in Ignition Gazebo

[Video Walktrough and Demo](https://youtu.be/CXA4HDUVAnM)

This demo provides a simulation environment for the TurtleBot3 robot using **Ignition Gazebo (Fortress)** and ROS 2. It is designed to be used with the **ROS-MCP Server** to enable LLM-controlled robotics interactions.

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **ROS 2** (Humble or newer recommended)
- **Ignition Gazebo** (Fortress)
- **ros-ign-bridge**
- **ROS-MCP Server** (installed in your workspace)
- **Python 3.10+**

## 2. Installation

Navigate to the root of your workspace (e.g., `~/ros2_ws`) and build the package:

```bash
# Clone the repository if you haven't already
# git clone <repo_url> src/demos-ros-mcp-server

# Build the specific package
colcon build --packages-select turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulations turtlebot3_msgs DynamixelSDK hls_lfcd_lds_driver

# Source the setup script
source install/setup.bash
```

## 3. Running the Simulation

You can launch various worlds and robot models.

### Select Robot Model

Set the `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL` environment variable to one of the following: `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi`.

```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
```

### Launch Commands

To launch the simulation in Ignition Gazebo with the ROS bridge:

```bash
# Set resource path for Ignition
export IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=$IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH:$(pwd)/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/models

# Launch
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo ignition_turtlebot.launch.py
```

## 4. ROS-MCP Server Integration

The **ROS-MCP Server** allows you to connect an LLM (Large Language Model) to this simulation to inspect topics, call services, and control the robot.

### Running the Server

In a new terminal, run the ROS-MCP server:

```bash
# Source your workspace
source install/setup.bash

# Run the server
ros2 run ros_mcp_server server
```

### Capabilities

Once the server is running, the connected MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor) can perform the following:

-   **Inspect System State**:
    -   List all active nodes: `ros2 node list` via agent.
    -   List all topics: `ros2 topic list` via agent.
    -   Read sensor data: `get_topic_message("/scan")` or `get_topic_message("/odom")`.

-   **Control the Robot**:
    -   Publish velocity commands to move the robot:
        ```python
        # Agent can publish to /cmd_vel
        publish_message("/cmd_vel", "geometry_msgs/msg/Twist", "{linear: {x: 0.1, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}")
        ```

-   **Navigation (if nav2 is running)**:
    -   The agent can trigger navigation actions if the specifics are set up (this demo focuses on simulation bringup).
